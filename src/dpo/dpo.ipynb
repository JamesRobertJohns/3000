    "The following is a summary of the project, including methodology, rationale, and key considerations for reproducing the experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Task 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset was generated using custom scripts. These scripts, along with accompanying documentation, are located in `src/utils`. Further explanation is provided in the notebook (`.ipynb`).\n",
    "- Large language models (LLMs) and their smaller variants, such as NanoGPT, do not inherently understand logical or mathematical reasoning; they primarily learn **statistical patterns in tokens**. Therefore, they are simply predicting the most probable token based on the context of all previous tokens.\n",
    "- Consequently, we constrained the scope of arithmetic problems to a **limited domain**, covering a wide range of representative cases while avoiding exhaustive permutations. This ensures that the model **learns underlying patterns rather than memorising individual examples**, promoting genuine generalisation.\n",
    "- In designing the dataset, we considered the **distribution of problem types and difficulty**. For example, we weighted smaller numbers more heavily to approximate natural frequencies in arithmetic tasks and ensured balanced coverage across operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This careful sampling mitigates the risk of bias and promotes robust model performance across the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Task 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "*(To be completed)*\n",

    "*(To be completed)*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Extra Training and Generalisation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on the results of initial experiments, we conducted additional training to enable the model to generalise to a broader domain of arithmetic problems.\n",
    "* As expected, extending the domain introduced some **catastrophic forgetting**, wherein the model occasionally failed cases it had previously solved correctly.\n",
    "* To mitigate this, we carefully designed the training data to **interleave previously seen problem types** with new examples. This strategy reduces forgetting while improving performance on a wider range of problems.\n",
    "* Overall, the approach reflects a trade-off between **domain expansion** and **retention of previously learned patterns**, a well-known challenge in sequential model training.\n",

    "1. **Sparse numerical density:**\n",
    "   The current dataset spans a wide range (1–999), resulting in large variation in operation outcomes (e.g., 999+999 vs. 999×999). Such disparity makes it difficult for the model to detect consistent numerical patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Uneven operator coverage:**\n",
    "   Simply distributing operations evenly is insufficient. For each number pair, all four operators (+, −, ×, ÷) should be applied so the model can clearly learn the distinctions introduced by each operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variable position bias:**\n",
    "   In the test cases, the variable (x) appears in varying positions, but the training data only followed one fixed pattern from the lab manual. To improve generalization, the model should also be trained on equations where (x) appears in different positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Mathematical Properties:**\n",
    "Perhaphs, the model would also perform better, if we made use of the fact that humans learn mathematics from axioms and fundamental mathematical operations. While it may be hard for the model to generalise the abstractions, we can nevertheless attempt to capture this by introducing some examples\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Focused numerical range**\n",
    "   Reduced the number range to smaller values to improve learning consistency and ensure the model performs reliably within that range before generalizing to larger numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identity property coverage**\n",
    "   Added explicit training samples demonstrating the role of zero and one in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These targeted examples help the model internalize fundamental mathematical identities (e.g., $a + 0 = a$, $a \\times 1 = a$).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Commutative and inverse property expansion**\n",
    "   Expanded the dataset to include examples illustrating the commutative property for addition and multiplication, along with corresponding subtraction and division cases. This strengthens the model’s grasp of symmetry and operation reversibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stratified numerical sampling**\n",
    "   Implemented stratified sampling across defined number ranges (1–10, 11–30, 31–70, 71–100) to ensure dense and balanced representation of small, medium, and large values. This minimizes gaps and prevents bias toward specific magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Refined prompt generation**\n",
    "   Enhanced arithmetic and algebraic prompt generation to include both direct computation and “solve for $x$” forms. Each category includes both positive and negative examples, improving the model’s robustness across different reasoning contexts.\n"

    "\n",
    "We observe that the model is unable to generalise this seemingly trivial mathematical property to larger numbers. This suggests that the model has been trained too narrowly on numbers between 0 and 100 and cannot generalise to bigger values. In our training dataset, this property was taught by multiplying any number `i` in the range by 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a positive outcome is that the model is able to generalise the commutative property for two digit numbers. In our training, this was learned using a small range of numbers between 1 and 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **On Language Models**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, large language models, from smaller ones like NanoGPT to larger systems such as GPT-4 or GPT-5, are **language models rather than symbolic reasoning engines**. They learn statistical relationships between tokens (words, numbers, symbols) in text rather than the underlying mathematical structures or rules these symbols represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the only way to improve generalisation would be to increase the size and variety of the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡This is because this task expects a particular output format. If this were not the case, the training could include explicit statements such as “any number multiplied by 0 equals 0”. This would have made the results better"

    "### Extra: Model Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "While the current training results are satisfactory, the model’s performance can be further enhanced through an additional fine-tuning phase on top of the existing checkpoint. This stage aims to strengthen the model’s understanding of certain arithmetic and algebraic patterns while maintaining knowledge from previous training.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this phase are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improve performance for algebraic problems involving addition with x.\n",
    "   However, the dataset should not consist solely of such examples. Overexposure to one operation may cause the model to associate x too strongly with addition, leading to incorrect generalization or memorization of fixed patterns. To counter this, other operations will also be included in moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enable better generalization for simple three-digit additions and subtractions.\n",
    "   For addition, “simple” refers to cases where one operand has trailing zeros, such as 300+21=321. These are easier for the model to learn because the positional structure of digits remains clear. Nevertheless, the dataset will also include a smaller proportion of non-zero-ending numbers to ensure the model does not assume that all three-digit additions follow a predictable replacement pattern.\n",
    "   For subtraction, examples will be constructed such that the result is nonnegative, maintaining consistency with the constraints of previous datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Improve generalization for two-digit multiplication and division.\n",
    "   These operations tend to be more challenging due to their broader numeric range and variability in results. Including additional training examples for them helps the model develop a stronger grasp of multiplicative and divisive relationships, ensuring balanced performance across all basic arithmetic operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent the model from forgetting knowledge it has already learned, a portion of the original dataset will be reused. Specifically, 30% of the data (around 30,000 samples) will be drawn from pos_neg_pair.json. Random extraction will not be used, as this could lead to uneven representation of different operations. Instead, the same data generation functions and random seeds from earlier scripts will be reused to ensure balanced sampling and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining 70% (approximately 70,000 samples) will consist of newly generated data that emphasizes the updated training goals described above. This combination provides both continuity and novelty, allowing the model to retain prior knowledge while acquiring new patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, adjustments will be made to the optimizer and learning rate scheduler. These changes will help stabilize the fine-tuning process, ensuring that the model adapts smoothly to the new data without overfitting or experiencing abrupt changes in performance."
